						<h4>Micheal has to be one of my favourite Achievement Hunters. He joined right after the conception of Achievement Hunter. His famed Rage Quit videos are some of the best content on YouTube.</h4>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-3">
						<h2 class="text-center">Gavin</h2>
						<h4>Gavin has been at AH just as long as Micheal. He was a member of the parent site Roosterteeth since he first seen "Red Vs Blue". He also has his own channel called "The Slo mo guys" which has since been incorporated into RT as one of its own.</h4>

					<div class="col-md-3">
						<h2 class="text-center">Geoff</h2>
						<h4>Geoff is the founder of Achievement Hunter. Geoff worked as a voice actor on the show "Red vs Blue" he also is a founder of Roosterteeth. In his time at Roosterteeth he came up with the idea of doing helpful gameplay videos for Achievement hunting.</h4>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-3">
						<h2 class="text-center">Jack</h2>
						<h4>Jack is the genius behind bringing Achievement Hunter to live audiences with "Let's Play Live". This concept was a huge hit with the Achievement Hunter audience since its first trial run in Austin Texas where the company is based, They have had succesful events in LA, Chicago, and soon to be NYC.</h4>

						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UB1gmjXtSJo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<h4 class="text-center">Lets's plays are a staple of a gaming channel on YouTube, but AH seem to have perfected the formula. It's with videos such as the one above that proves this.</h3>

						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TMmJDha2RF4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<h4 class="text-center">The versus series is a great for showing off some in house competitive gameplay. Most of the time they play co-op games with an objective. So its nice to get some one on one every now and again.</h4>

						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/njauePtToIU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<h4 class="text-center">Play Pals is a relativlely new concept, originally airing with Micheal and Gavin at the helm. We have seen over time Ryan and Geoff joining in with their attempts at Spec ops missions in Call of Duty.</h4>

						<h3 class="text-center">Funhaus</h3>
						<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8u2E--oS7MY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<h4 class="text-center">Funhaus are part of the Roosterteeth family so every once in a while get hilarious crossover gameplay. Its a great mix of competitiveness and hilarity, a great fit for the Roosterteeth family.</h4>

						<h2 class="text-center"><a href="http://funhaus.roosterteeth.com/">Funhaus</a></h2>						
						<h4 class="text-center">Funhaus are like the older brother that Achievement Hunter never asked for but to their dismay, received. Good thing they fit perfectly in the Roosterteeth ecosystem then. They have worked together for such a long time, which comes across on camera. They all ended up together at IGN until they decided to choose a different path and setup Funhaus. </h4>

					<div class="col-md-4">
						<h2 class="text-center"><a href="http://gameattack.roosterteeth.com/">Game Attack</a></h2>						
						<h4 class="text-center">Game Attack are the newest brainchild for lack of a better word. They are a special bunch. They love to play Super Mario and any other Nintendo game that they can get their hands on</h4>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4">
						<h2 class="text-center"><a href="https://www.kindafunny.com/">Kinda Funny</a></h2>						
						<h4 class="text-center">Kinda Funny are a recent addition to the Roosterteeth family but are in the same style as Funhaus. So they obviously fit right in with the theme of AH. They also have a similar background to Funhaus as their background is in gaming media with IGN. Greg MIller is the key influencer and his friendships within Roosterteeth made the Kinda Funny transition so much easier. </h4>

						<h2 class="text-center">Theater Mode</h2>
						<h4 class="text-center">Theater Mode is another new creation from the crazed mind of Geoff Ramsey. It's not for the feint of heart either. They get together and watch the worst movies they could find a licence to show. They then proceed to rip the movie to shreds, it's fantastic.</h4>

						<h4 class="text-center">Such is the success of Achievement Hunter, it feels like they can make anything funny and entertaining. So why not try your hand at a full Dungeons & Dragons playthrough? An episodic adventure uploaded every week. They truly delivered on this one!</h4>

Last year they helped raise over $680,000 for charity, with Micheal putting his body on the line by being shot by Jack with a tazer, not once, but twice! Anything for the kids though right?</h4>
